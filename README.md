## Multivariate Time Series Mining 
### 1. Univariate Shapelet Extraction (USE)
### 2. Sequential Shapelet Extraction (SSE)
This project aims at optimizing the performance of SSE process and make it scalable in the contexte of Big Data. 
Based on Apache Spark, we have deployed the implementation in a distributed cluster. Which showed a 5X faster performance of processing time.
